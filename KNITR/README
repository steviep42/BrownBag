This is a readme file describing the Krall_repro_knitr folder, which includes
examples of reproducible research and dynamic documents using knitr.

1. slides folder

Contains presentation and accompanying graphics.  To view as .Rpres (R code 
plus markdown), open in Rstudio.  You can use Rstudio to compile into a .html
file, or open the existing .html file in your browser of choice.  

2. ex1

This example is a basic knitr example showing how I've incorporated knitr
into my manuscript preparation.  The cache and files folders are updated
by knitr.  Open the .html file in a browser to see the finished document or
open the .Rmd file (in an editor or Rstudio) to view the R + markdown.

3. ex2 

This example shows how to cache other files using knitr.  Open both the .R and
.Rmd files to view how the .html file is created.

4. ex3

This example gives some examples of how you can integrate knitr with other
recent R tools to create interactive documents with maps and applications.
